# Diamond
An easy and simple programming language.

## Official website
Here's Diamond official website: https://diamondlang.pythonanywhere.com

## Future features
* logical operators (`and`, `or`).
* functions.
* Object Orientation.
* More mature strings (escape characters, string length, etc.).

## About this project
I started this project so that I can learn more about how programming languages works and improve my programming skills. The primary Diamond's purpose is to be super easier to learn and to use. If this language becomes useful for people I will probably implement Diamond in C so it can be much faster.
