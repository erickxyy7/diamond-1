The relational operators are:
==
!=
<
<=
>
>=

They compare two values.

Example:
x = 3 == 3
puts x

Output: True

The `if` keyword changes the program flow based on the expression on it. If the
expression is false, the program doesn't executes the `if`'s code block,
if the expression is true, the program executes the `if`'s code block.

Example:
age = 19
if age < 18
    puts "You can't drink."
end
